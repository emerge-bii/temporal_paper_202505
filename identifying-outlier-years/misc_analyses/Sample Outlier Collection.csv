717_P1_1-5,,Microbial,1/4,"This sample is a palsa sample who's pairwise comparisons in BetaNTI assembly metric are abnormally high. That is to say, they look more like Fen values of BetaNTI than palsa values. More specifically  this means that this sample has greater phylogenetic turnover than we'd expect by chance. And that is abnormal for a Palsa sample, which typically have less phylogenetic turnover than we'd expect by chance. ",Hannah,MAG abundances,Also seen in the ordinations - Dylan
